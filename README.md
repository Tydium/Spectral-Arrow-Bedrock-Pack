# Spectral Arrows for Bedrock
A pack to be used with the Geyser Proxy + Geyser Optional Pack + A Custom Mapping

A simple "quality of life" pack made to show the spectral arrows in the hotbar. Geyser Optional pack provides the Entity texture for the Arrow, but not the hotbar item (which isn't doable right now at the moment due to not being able to ensure that everyone has the pack).

## Requirements
- [Geyser Optional Pack](https://github.com/GeyserMC/GeyserOptionalPack)
- Your own instance of [Geyser](https://geysermc.org/)

## Setup
1. Download from the newest release and unzip it's contents.
2. Drag "spectral_arrow.json" into the "custom_mappings" folder of the Geyser Proxy Folder.
3. Drag the "spectral_arrow.mcpack" into the "packs" folder of the Geyser Proxy Folder. Also put in Geyser Optional Pack if you haven't done it already.
4. Boot your server or the geyser proxy and then join the server on bedrock edition. Make sure you accept the pack on joining if force-resource-packs is off.

## Notes
- Your console may show "[Geyser-Spigot] The custom item spectral_arrow has no registration types". This can safely be ignored.
- You can merge the Geyser Optional Pack and this resource pack if you would like. This goes for your own texture packs as well.
